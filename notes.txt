Following things that you learnt:
I.use express,app.get //call back function added for req,res
,app.listen,
deployed on server-render by pushing it into github
II.connecting frontend with backend:-
added usestate in frontend:-//state to store data from backend
various ways like fetching..
but here we used axios to fetch data from backend:req,res.error in frontend:-
problems occur:CORS--lot of request from lot of servers,allow them as per your wish
:-
ways to solve whitelisting in backend, add proxy
we used proxy(how to add it depend on bundlers of choice(vite,createapp,parcel))
bad practice:- adding dist from frontent into backend
in backend add middleware to use this dist :-app.use(express.static ('dist'))
npm run build is used to get dist ---in frontend
